# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data anlyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql)

### The questions that I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills dta, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the sills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.
```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS skill_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    skill_salary DESC
LIMIT 25
```
### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn
Combining insights from demand and salary data, this query aimed to pinpoint skills that are both in high demand and have high salaries, offering a strategic focus for skills development.
```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
),
skills_salary AS (
    SELECT
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS skill_salary
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    GROUP BY
        skills_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    skill_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
    INNER JOIN skills_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = skills_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    demand_count > 10
ORDER BY
    skill_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25
```
Each query not only served wo answer a specific question but also improve my understanding of SQL and database analysis. Through this project, I learned to leverage SQL's powerful data manipulation capabilities to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
# What I learned
1. SQL uses and sytax
2. Database manipulation
3. Specific use cases for SQL functions
4. Form control and sharing through GitHub

# Conclusions
Through this project and its course I have been introduced to the basics of using SQL to analyze and manipulate databases. The results from the queries in the project will help me guide my efforts to start a career in data analytics.
